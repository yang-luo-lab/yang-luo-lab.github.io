# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

We are a research group working to understand how genetics shapes the immune system and its role in human health. Our main focus is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a key genomic region that helps our immune system recognize and respond to disease. For many immune-related conditions, variation in the MHC contributes more to risk than all other parts of the genome combined. Yet the biological reasons for this remain unclear.

To address these questions, we use large-scale health resources such as the UK Biobank, China Kadoorie Biobank, and the Mexico City Prospective Study. We also integrate multiple layers of biological data, including gene activity (transcriptomics), protein levels (proteomics), and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, to uncover how genetic variation leads to disease.

Our ultimate goal is to connect genetic discoveries with their underlying molecular mechanisms, paving the way for better understanding, prevention, and treatment of immune-related diseases.
