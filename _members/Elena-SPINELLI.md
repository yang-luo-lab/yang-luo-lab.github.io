Elena is a PhD student in the course “Personalized Medicine and Innovative Therapies” at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health “Burlo Garofolo” in Trieste, Italy. She holds a Master’s degree in Medical Biotechnology from the University of Trieste. Her PhD project focuses on omic analyses to investigate the potential and limitations of organoids as in vitro models of intestinal disorders, with a particular focus on celiac disease. With a growing interest in bioinformatics, she is currently spending a research period at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology supervised by Yang to further develop her skills in omic data analysis to complete her PhD project.
