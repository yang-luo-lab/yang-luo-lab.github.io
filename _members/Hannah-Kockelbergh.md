Hannah is a postdoc supervised by Yang with an interest in T-cell receptors and their relationship to variation within the major histocompatibility complex region. During her PhD at the University of Liverpool, she developed and applied machine learning methods to interpret data obtained via T-cell receptor repertoire sequencing in the context of autoimmune disease. She has also worked on application of machine learning to particle accelerator technology, and has an integrated Masters degree in Engineering.
