Yang is a Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research (KTRR) Senior Research Fellow in Data Science. 

Yang obtained her MSci from Imperial College London, and Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge with Professor Lorenz Wernisch. For her postdoc training, Yang turned her research focus towards human genetics, and did her training with Dr. Jeffrey Barrett at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in human genetics. Yang's research at the Sanger Institute centred around uncovering the genetic factors that predispose humans to tuberculosis and inflammatory bowel disease. Subsequently, Yang adventured to the US and became an instructor at Harvard Medical School with Professor Soumya Raychaudhuri, where she focused on the multi-ancestry genetic study of complex traits, including the study of TB progression in Peruvians, developing novel statistical methods for dissecting the genetic architecture of polygenic traits in admixed populations, and constructing a global HLA haplotype panel to facilitate association and fine-mapping in the MHC region.
